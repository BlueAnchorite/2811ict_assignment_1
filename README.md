# Summary
This is a solution for Assignment 2 in 3813ICT - Web Programming, built upon the solution for Assignment 1 from Ryoma.


# Installation
## Node Server
Change directory to **server** and run **npm install**. Run server by running **node server.js** and the Node server will start listening on port 8080. Node server is set up to accept CORS from **0.0.0.0:8081**. 

## Angular App
Change directory to **chat-app** an drun **npm install**. You can run the Angular server by **ng serve**. As CORS is set up on the Node server, this will still allow you send data between the Angular chat app and the node server. **ng build** will create the distributable, compiled version of the Angular app. The Node server will already be preconfigured to run **dist/index.html**.
